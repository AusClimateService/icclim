Welcome to ICCLIM's documentation!
===============================

*Index Calculation CLIMate* is a python libary designed for calculation of climate indices and indicators. 
For the first time the climate indices calculated by this librarie are the `ECA&D climate indices <http://eca.knmi.nl/documents/atbd.pdf>`_.
Later other climate indices and indicators will be added.

.. warning:: At the moment we are working on calling ICCLIM from `OpenClimateGIS <http://ncpp.github.io/ocgis/index.html>`_ that should be more reliable that useing ICCLIM as a standalone package :)
