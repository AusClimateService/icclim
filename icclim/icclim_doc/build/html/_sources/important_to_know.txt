Important to know
===============================
Here is an overview of some important points.

1. Input files must be compliant to the `CF convention <http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-conventions/>`_.
2. For the moment, ICCLIM processes only CMIP5 and CORDEX datasets.
3. Actually, indices could be calculated as annual or monthly values.
4. For the moment, ICCLIM doesn't support spatial subsetting, i.e. it processes all spatial area.
5. ICCLIM works with unsecured OPeNDAP datasets as well.
