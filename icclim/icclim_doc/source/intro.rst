What is a climate indice
-------------------------
A climate index is a calculated value that can be used to describe the state and the changes in the climate system.

The climate at a defined place is the average state of the atmosphere over a longer period of, for example, months or years. Changes on climate are much slower than on the weather, that can change strongly day by day.

Climate indices allow a statistical study of variations of the dependent climatological aspects, such as analysis and comparison of time series, means, extremes and trends.
