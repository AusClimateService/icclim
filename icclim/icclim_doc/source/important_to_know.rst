Important to know
===============================
Here is an overview of some important points.

1. Input files must be compliant to the `CF convention <http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-conventions/>`_.
2. Indices could be calculated as annual or monthly values.
3. For the moment, ICCLIM doesn't support spatial subsetting, i.e. it processes whole spatial area.
4. ICCLIM works with unsecured OPeNDAP datasets as well.
